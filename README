ConstantContact
===============
This is a very activeresource-like ruby wrapper to the constant contact api.  It's not quite done yet and if you are interested in using this code, check it out, and message me with questions. 



Example
=======

ConstantContact::List.find(1)
ConstantContact::List.find :all
